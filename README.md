# FCC Comment Analysis

### Overview

After attending a full-time Data Science course at General Assembly London, I chose to focus my final project on analysing the FCC comment submission regarding Net-Neutrality. I used gensim's word embeddings algorithm Doc2Vec and the clustering algorithm HDBSCAN to seperate bot generated comments from real, unique comments.
